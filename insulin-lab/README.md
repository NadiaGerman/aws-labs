# 🧪 Insulin Sequence and Molecular Weight Lab

This lab applies Python basics to a real-world biology use case — working with the protein sequence of **human insulin**. You will manipulate strings, use built-in methods, and calculate the **molecular weight** of insulin based on amino acid composition.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Assign protein sequences to variables
- Use string concatenation and `print()` to display output
- Calculate the molecular weight of human insulin
- Compare calculated weight to the actual molecular weight
- Practice variable types, dictionaries, and loops

---

## 🧬 Sequence Overview

- `preproInsulin` – full sequence of human preproinsulin
- `lsInsulin`, `bInsulin`, `aInsulin`, `cInsulin` – sliced segments of insulin
- `insulin` – combined B and A chain representing active insulin

## ⚙️ How to Run

### ✅ Step 1: Clone the Repo or Copy the File
Ensure you're inside the `insulin-lab/` directory.

```bash
cd ~/environment/insulin-lab
python3 string_insulin_lab.py
```

### 🖨️ Output Includes:
- Insulin sequences
- Calculated molecular weight
- Error percentage compared to actual molecular weight (5807.63 Da)

---

## 💡 Concepts Used

- Python 3
- Variables and strings
- Dictionaries and loops
- Float math and casting
- PEP8: line breaks with `\`
